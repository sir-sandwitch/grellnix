# Grellnix

Grellnix is a unix like OS built off of <a href="http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/">James Molloy's OS tutorial</a> with fixes provided by me based on https://wiki.osdev.org/James_Molloy%27s_Tutorial_Known_Bugs and some parts done on my own (paging + multitasking)

currently done is up to part 10 (user mode).
